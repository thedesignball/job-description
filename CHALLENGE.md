# Full-stack Web Developer

__*Challenge:*__ Create a working, two page Node.js website.

## Requirements

- Install the latest version of Node.js (and npm) on your computer.
- Create a very basic website using the [Express framework](http://expressjs.com/).
- It should respond to two different routes, and output some HTML to the screen. It can say anything.

## Rules

- You must use Git and GitHub.
- Please send us a link to your GitHub page where we can review your code.

## Bonus points

For bonus points, set it up on Heroku so we can preview the working version of your code. Here is a nice [guide to getting started with Node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

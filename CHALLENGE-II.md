__*Challenge - II:*__ Add a MongoDB database to your Express app with the ability to create, edit and view records.

This is an extension of the first challenge.

## Requirements

- Install MongoDB on your computer.
- Add GET and POST routes which allows you to create a record in the database.
- Add a GET route which allows you to view these records from the database.
- Add a GET and POST route which allows you to edit a record in the database.
- Add a DELETE route which allows you to delete a record from the database.
- All record view, create, edit and delete routes (not routes from the first challenge) must be protected by a custom middleware that will return a HTTP status of 404, unless a cookie called 'allowed' has a value of 'yes'.

## Rules

- You must use Mongoose to manage your MongoDB dataset. The dataset can be anything, but keep it simple (one or two properties).
- You must use Git and GitHub.
- Please send us a link to your GitHub page where we can review your code.

## Bonus points

For bonus points, set it up on Heroku.
